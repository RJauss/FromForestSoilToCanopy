# From forest soil to the canopy: Increased habitat diversity does not increase species richness of Cercozoa and Oomycota in tree canopies

Welcome to the **From Forest Soil to the Canopy** repository!

This repository is a collection of several scripts and mini-tutorials guiding you through the methods of metabarcoding analyses which were performed in the paper by [Jauss & Walden et al., 2020]().

Most scripts here deal with the data for oomycetes, but they were also applied for Cercozoa if not stated otherwise. The raw data can be downloaded [here](), plots and figures were generated with the final OTU tables and annotation files accessible in the folder [00_Data](00_Data/). 

## Table of Content
### 00_Data
This folder contains the final OTU table, taxonomic annotation, sample metadata as well as the oligosheet for demultiplexing the raw data. Intermediate files are not provided here, but you can generate them yourself by following the next steps.

### 01_Metabarcoding-Pipeline
[Here](01_Metabarcoding-Pipeline/Metabarcoding-Pipeline.md) you find the neccessary scripts to generate the (unfiltered) OTU table from raw .fastq files.
